# Home_Sales

This repository contains my solution to the **Module 22 Home-Sales** challenge.

## Module Overview

For this assignment, we had to use our knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then, we used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

Additionally, we had to answer the following questions using SparkSQL:

1. **What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?**  
   _Round to two decimal places._

2. **What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?**  
   _Round to two decimal places._

3. **What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?**  
   _Round to two decimal places._

4. **What is the average price of a home per "view" rating, having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000?**  
   _Determine the runtime for this query, round to two decimal places._
